Big 7 changes

Nothing more
Nothing less


1. End Inflation. Life gets more affordable for every Canadian
2. End income tax. Citizens keep what they earn. No coercive extortion
3. End property tax. Citizens have a right to own a home
4. End capital gains tax. Citizens have a right to keep what they earn on investments
5. End carbon taxes. Net zero is a fraud and makes life more expensive for all citizens
6. Provincial and community governance. Eliminate Federal government. The leader of Canada is elected by the people and must have served as a premier of a province. Canada is a republic of provinces
7. Initiate covid19 trials. Modern day equivalent of Nuremburg trials. Held at Gitmo, everything publicly.
