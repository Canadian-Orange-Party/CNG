Isaiah 11: 13-14

Rather than compete or argue with one another, God's people unite to oppose evil

Write a letter to God's people in Canada

Wickedness gas taken control of the nation of Canada

Rather than argue or compete with one another, we must unite to abolish evil

This is our calling as Guardians of the nation

1. Bitcoin is a protocol, not a product

2. Bitcoin has no CEO, no headquarters, no board of directors, no customer support hotline. It is a protocol - a set of rules that computers follow to reach consensus on the state of a shared ledger

3. Bitcoin is like language, mathematics or the internet. Nobody owns or controls English or arithmetic. No government grants permission to the internet

4. Bitcoin is a tool and a system that emerged, spread and has become embedded into civilization because it is useful, open and neutral

5. Bitcoin is an open protocol for transmitting and storing value that anyone can use, anyone can verify, and nobody can co-opt

6. Bitcoin is open source software. Anyone can read the code, every line is publicly available for all to read, audit and scrutinize

7. No single developer, company, or funding source can unilaterally change the protocol. Changes are submitted, must survive extensive peer review and obtain overwhelming consensus among network node runners before being activated. Bitcoin is very hard to change
