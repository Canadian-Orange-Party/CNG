Isaiah 11: 13-14

Rather than compete or argue with one another, God's people unite to oppose evil

Write a letter to God's people in Canada

Wickedness gas taken control of the nation of Canada

Rather than argue or compete with one another, we must unite to abolish evil

This is our calling as Guardians of the nation
