Vox populi, vox Dei is a Latin proverb translating to "the voice of the people [is] the voice of God." 

It implies that the majority opinion or collective will of the public carries supreme authority and correctness, often used in democratic contexts to suggest that widespread consensus constitutes a form of divine truth or ultimate judgment

It is often used to emphasize that political power or authority comes from the people.


Courts that bring normal people to exact justice

Covid19 courts: citizens can submit evidence of hardship created by covid19 politices and seek remunerative compensation from individuals who created or enforced the actions. All evidence is considered. 



Justice is a service.

Like all services, it degrades under monopoly and improves under competition. 

Court systems that governments built will endure for as long as governments can compel their use. 

Merchants (Citizens), as they have done for a thousand years, will keep building something faster.
