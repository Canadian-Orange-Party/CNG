[Based on the words of Jocko Willink, as written in his book: The code. The evaluation. The protocols.]

As a serving member of the Canadian National Guard, I aspire toward this code of excellence.

1. I will take care of my physical health by exercising, eating properly and getting the rest I need to recover and rebuild. I will take care of my physical surroundings, keeping them in order. 

2. I will develop myself mentally by reading, writing, building, creating and engaging in other activities that sharpen and expand my mind.

3. I will not waste time. Time is precious.

4. I will store my time in sound money. I will not waste money and I will make prudent financial decisions. Money is hard to earn and I will steward it wisely. 

5. I will set goals that I will strive toward.

6. I will excel in my work because work is integral to life.

7. I will be hunble and not allow my ego to negatively impact my decisions.

8. I will control my emotions and now allow my emotions to negatively impact my decisions. 

9. I will put God's will before mine. I will help others and protect those who cannot protect themselves. I will take care of my friends and family and treat other people with respect. 

10. I will be ready to protect my friends and family. My gear will be ready. I will train and prepare to defend myself and others.
