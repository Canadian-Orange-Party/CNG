As a serving member of the Canadian National Guard, I aspire toward this code of excellence.

1. I will take care of my physical health by exercising, eating properly and getting the rest I need to recover and rebuild. I will take care of my physical surroundings, keeping them in order. 

2. I will develop myself mentally by reading, writing, building, creating and engaging in other activities that sharpen and expand my mind.

3.
